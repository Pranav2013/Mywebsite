          Batman[a] is a superhero appearing in American comic books published
          by DC Comics. The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer
          Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book Detective
          Comics on March 30, 1939. In the DC Universe continuity, Batman is the
          alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and
          industrialist who resides in Gotham City. Batman's origin story
          features him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the
          murder of his parents Thomas and Martha as a child, a vendetta
          tempered with the ideal of justice. He trains himself physically and
          intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors the Gotham
          streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other creators accompanied Batman
          with supporting characters, including his sidekicks Robin and Batgirl;
          allies Alfred Pennyworth, James Gordon, and Catwoman; and foes such as
          the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, and his archenemy, the Joker.

          a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel
          Comics, often in association with the X-Men. He is a mutant with
          animal-keen senses, enhanced physical capabilities, a powerful
          regenerative ability known as a healing factor, a skeleton reinforced
          with the unbreakable fictional metal adamantium, and three retractable
          claws in each hand. In addition to the X-Men, Wolverine has been
          depicted as a member of X-Force, Alpha Flight, the Fantastic Four, and
          the Avengers. The common depiction of Wolverine is multifaceted; he is
          portrayed at once as a gruff loner, susceptible to animalistic
          “berserker rages” despite his best efforts, while simultaneously being
          an incredibly knowledgeable and intelligent polyglot, strategist, and
          martial artist, partially due to his extended lifespan and expansive
          lived experiences
