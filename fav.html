    <h2>Cricket</h2>

    <p>
      Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that is played between two teams of eleven
      players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch
      with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three
      stumps. Two players from the batting team (the striker and nonstriker)
      stand in front of either wicket, with one player from the fielding team
      (the bowler) bowling the ball towards the striker's wicket from the
      opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball
      and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring
      one run for each exchange. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches or
      crosses the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled

    <h2>Badminton</h2>

    <p>
      Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock
      across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common
      forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles"
      (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor
      activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular
      indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the
      racquet and landing it within the other team's half of the court.

      Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,
      kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally
      means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is
      used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known
      as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and
      sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic
      football; gridiron football (specifically American football, Arena
      football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby
      league football; and rugby union football.[1] These various forms of
      football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as
      "football codes.

    <h2>Basketball</h2>

    <p>
      Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five
      players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with
      the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches
      (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46
      cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end
      of the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through
      their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind
      the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play
      stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is
      given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most
      points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with
      the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.

    <h2>Baseball</h2>

    <p>
      Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players
      each, taking turns batting and fielding. The game occurs over the course
      of several plays, with each play generally beginning when a player on the
      fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the
      batting team, called the batter, tries to hit with a bat. The objective of
      the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of
      play, away from the other team's players, allowing its players to run the
      bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score
      what are called "runs". The objective of the defensive team (referred to
      as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to
      prevent runners' advance around the bases.[2] A run is scored when a
      runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate
      (the place where the player started as a batters
